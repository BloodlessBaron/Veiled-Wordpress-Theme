# Veiled Landing Page

This used to be a landing page for my Veiled Beyond Banality personal site, but I decided to go all out and make it into a Wordpress theme. It's compact, minimal, and not a great fit for most sites. But for those of you who tend to write shorter posts like I do, it'll do fine.

This theme is not yet uploaded to Wordpress.org, and won't be until I think it's mature enough to be.
