  <p class="paragraph">Welcome! You've reached the landing page for my personal site, wayward traveller. Choose now
  the path you will take in this, your journey beyond the veil of the banal.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">You might take the path that leads to my journals, my personal accounting of my own
  travels in this strange and sometimes perilous web of information they call the Internet.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Or you might decide to peruse my tomes of knowledge, the arcane texts I have developed
  over the years. With the correct instruments, these modest tools of thaumaturgy might allow you to perform
  works that will astound the ignorant minds of the masses.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Another path you could take is to view the myriad pieces of artwork I have created.
  While I have no great skill, I am proud of them, and hope you will find them pleasing to the eyes as I do.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">Finally, if you must contact me, and have access to enchanted mail, you might send me
  a scroll with your query, and I will respond to you as soon as I am able to.</p>
