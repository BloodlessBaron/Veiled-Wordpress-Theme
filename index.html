      <p>Welcome! You've reached the landing page for my personal site, wayward traveller. Choose now
      the path you will take in this, your journey beyond the veil of the banal.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>You might take the path that <a href="https://veiled.xyz/blog">leads to my journals</a>, my personal accounting of my own
      travels in this strange and sometimes perilous web of information they call the Internet.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Or you might decide to <a href="https://gitlab.com/BloodlessBaron">peruse my tomes of knowledge</a>, the arcane texts I have developed
      over the years. With the correct instruments, these modest tools of thaumaturgy might allow you to perform
      works that will astound the ignorant minds of the masses.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Another path you could take is to <a href="#">view the myriad pieces of artwork</a> I have created.
      While I have no great skill, I am proud of them, and hope you will find them as pleasing to the eyes as I do.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Finally, if you must contact me, and have access to enchanted mail, you might <a href="mailto:bloodlessbaron@protonmail.com">send me
      a scroll with your query</a>, and I will respond to you as soon as I am able to.</p>
